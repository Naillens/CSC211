A generic in programming (especially in Java) allows you to write classes, interfaces, and methods that can operate on different data types without losing type safety.

Example:

ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<>();


ArrayList is defined using a generic type <T>, meaning it can store any type you specify at compile time.
Benefits of generics:

Type safety (prevents storing the wrong type)

No need for type casting

Reusable code that works with multiple types

In short: Generics let you create flexible, reusable code that remains strictly typed.

2. In which situation/set-up is recursion best avoided?

Recursion should generally be avoided when:

The problem requires very deep or large recursive calls

Risk of stack overflow if the recursion goes too deep.

A simple iterative solution exists

Loops are often faster and more memory-efficient.

Performance and efficiency are critical

Recursive calls add overhead due to repeated function calls.

Example of where recursion is NOT ideal:

factorial(50000)  // will likely overflow stack


In these cases, an iterative approach is safer and more efficient.

3. When would we prefer throw/throws over try/catch?

We use throw/throws instead of try/catch when:

We don’t want to handle the exception in the current method

We want to let the calling method decide how to handle the error

We want to propagate the exception up the stack

Example:

public void readFile() throws IOException {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("data.txt");  // may throw error
}
